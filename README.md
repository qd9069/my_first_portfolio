## Description

```md
Welcome to my personal portfolio page!

In this webpage, you will see projects and work applications that I have been developed and deployed. 

The main purpose of this project is to build my first Portfolio Webpage and to practise my skills in HTML and CSS. This gives me a very good opptunity to practise skills such as flexbox, media queries, and the use of variables in CSS. 

I had so much fun while working on this project ‚ù§Ô∏è 

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or comments regarding my portfolio webpage or other projects!
